ACTUAL SIZE PRENATAL DHAGNC Prenatal DHA is a premium vegetarian source of DHA tailored specifically with the health of your baby in mind. Pregnancy is a special time in a woman's life and a time to be mindful of the nutritional needs of you and your baby. Maternal nutrition before during and after pregnancy affects both your well-being and your infant's growth.It is highly recommended that mothers ingest DHA during pregnant and while nursing for a number of reasons. DHA is a predominant structural omega-3 fatty acid in the brain and retina and is passed through the placenta to the baby. In fact more than half of the brain is made up of fats the majority of which is DHA. Following childbirth it is passed through breast milk. It plays a vital role in supporting the healthy development of a baby's brain eyes and nervous system. In addition DHA is also vital for a healthy heart and cardiovascular system. By aiding in the development of these body systems GNC Prenatal DHA provides baby with the nutritional support needed during the early phases of life. And best of all each softgel is enteric coated which allows it to break down and absorb in the small intestine. This controls or reduces the unpleasant aftertaste or burps.A complete nutritional program should be followed prior to conception through pregnancy and maintenance while breastfeeding.

Experts agree that the most protective form of Vitamin E is Gamma Tocopherol yet virtually all multi-vitamins and Vitamin E formulas contain only the less protective Alpha Vitamin E. The presence of high levels of more protective Gamma Vitamin E makes ELITE LIFE Rx unique and now we do so in an ultra-mild All Powder formula. ELITE LIFE Rx comes as an ultra-fine powder in small easy-to-swallow capsules that are guaranteed gentle even to sensitive stomachs. ELITE LIFE Rx provides all the benefits you seek without the problems typically associated with a multi-vitamin. Men\u2019s ELITE LIFE Rx plus OMEGA-3 includes our new Maximum Essential Omega-3 which provides a unique blend of Omega-3 oils without mercury PCBs and with no fishy aftertaste. Just as we require vitamins to live the essential Omega-3 fatty acids are also required for life. The Omega-3s comprise our trillions of cell membranes and they are only available from a diet rich in cold water fish or with a supplement like Maximum Essential Omega-3. Diets rich in Omega-3s are associated with superior heart nervous system and circulatory health. Sadly the American diet lacks the Omega-3s required or recommended for good health. Maximum Essential Omega-3 formula provides a unique balance of both fish and flaxseed oils delivering our highest levels of all-important DHA plus EPA and ALA. The heart benefits of DHA and EPA are long established but discovering DHA\u2019s role in brain and eye function is an enormous breakthrough. A typical Omega-3 formula focuses on EPA rather than DHA but Maximum Essential Omega-3 targets the more important DHA which is vital for the healthy function of the brain and eyes. In fact the highest functioning areas of the brain contain ultra-high levels of DHA including more than 30% of the \u201cgrey matter.\u201d Plus the highest concentrations of DHA are also found in the macula of the retina of the eye. Fish oil supplements have long been praised for their benefits but are equally well-known for their unpleasant aftertaste and contaminants; however our Maximum Essential Omega-3 allows you to enjoy all the benefits of fish oil without mercury contaminants or fishy aftertaste. Coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ10) \u2013 100 mg. Generally the first ingredient added to any multi-vitamin CoQ10 is critical for all cellular energy production while also a powerfully protective anti-oxidant. It must be present at high concentrations in our hardest working organs (heart brain liver and kidneys). Proper levels are required for our most vital organs to function at their best. CoQ10 levels decrease with age stress cholesterol-lowering drugs poor diet and even physical activity.Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) \u2013 100 mg. Because it is uniquely both water and fat soluble ALA is called the \u201cUniversal Anti-Oxidant.\u201d This unique solubility allows it to go virtually anywhere in your body protecting hard-to-reach tissues (brain and liver) from oxidative damage. Even more important is its role in the creation of our body\u2019s most powerful internal anti-oxidant \u2013 Glutathione. Like CoQ10 our levels of ALA decline further with age stress and the use of certain medications.Resveratrol \u2013 100 mg. Currently the subject of the most exciting anti-aging research and only recently available in an ultra-high potency natural form. Our 100 mg potency is the equivalent of more than 200 glasses of Red Wine. Resveratrol is the ingredient behind the benefits of Red Wine and a vital part of the healthy Mediterranean diet. Resveratrol offers powerful protection to the tissues of the heart brain and prostate; however it is Resveratrol\u2019s impact on the telomeres of our chromosomes that places it at the forefront of the latest anti-aging research.Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) \u2013 100 mg. EGCG from Green Tea combines thousands of years of traditional use with decades of remarkably compelling research. EGCG enhances the activity of our body\u2019s most important internal anti-oxidants including Glutathione. EGCG is also vital to our liver and therefore to our body\u2019s internal cleansing and detoxification systems while also offering vital and powerful protection to the delicate tissues of our brain heart prostate and skin.Pomegranate (40% Ellagic Acid\/40% Punicalagins) \u2013 100 mg. Used for centuries as a folk remedy and referred to as the \u201csacred fruit\u201d scientists have confirmed Pomegranate\u2019s unique protective benefits. Unfortunately most Pomegranate products including juices are not standardized to deliver any of its key beneficial compounds whereas our 40:40 Complex is standardized for both Punicalagins and Ellagic Acid assuring you all the benefits you seek from Pomegranate without the sugar and calories of Pomegranate Juice. Men\u2019s ELITE LIFE Rx plus OMEGA-3 delivers all the nutrients you seek without employing difficult to digest tablets and instead comes as an ultra-mild pure additive-free powder in small easy-to-swallow capsules. The ultra-fine non-acidic powder in each capsule effectively delivers its benefits while also being gentle even to the most sensitive stomach. THE PERFECT PACKET.The Perma-Fresh Purple Packet. The Only Packet Worthy of Our 100% Pure Products.Our Purple Packet is our most advanced packet ever offering even more protection than our original Foil Packet. To retain potency vitamins must be protected from light moisture and oxygen and the ordinary clear packets used with typical vitamins cannot do so.

Effectiveness.Andrew LessmanFounder of ProCaps Labs All-Solar Manufacturing  Andrew Lessman\u2019s Maximum Eye Support is a comprehensive high-potency blend of more than a dozen targeted nutrients phytonutrients and anti-oxidants to support healthy vision and protect the delicate tissues of the eye. Lutein and Zeaxanthin are two powerfully protective naturally occurring carotenoids and when consumed they will be most highly concentrated in the lens and macular region of the retina. Lutein and Zeaxanthin offer Mother Nature\u2019s most powerful protection from light-induced oxidative damage. These two remarkable ingredients were naturally designed to protect the lens and macula region of the retina from UV radiation Blue Light and other oxidative assaults. Lutein and Zeaxanthin can be concentrated to protect vulnerable eye tissues but since they cannot be produced by the body their benefits are only available from food or supplements. Given the low levels of Lutein and Zeaxanthin in the American diet supplementation is a vital consideration. Our quality of life depends on healthy eyes and vision and our Maximum Eye Support provides Mother Nature\u2019s best tools to protect the lens retina macula and other delicate tissues of the eye from a lifetime of oxidative assaults. Always Wear UV-Protective Sunglasses Outdoors.","60185":"Lutein is principally found in green vegetables and is most well-known for its central role in protecting the lens of the eye and macula region of the retina from a lifetime of oxidative damage. Lutein is most effective at protecting delicate eye tissues from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the normal aging process. Lutein improves visual acuity (sharpness of vision) and can also block harmful blue light from reaching vulnerable eye tissues. Not surprisingly diets rich in Lutein are associated with superior eye health. Lutein\u2019s protective benefits are also provided to other vital structures such as the reproductive organs breast tissue and the skin. Lutein cannot be made by the body so its benefits are only achieved when consumed in foods or in nutritional supplements. Sadly most Americans consume little or no Lutein daily because of our low consumption of green vegetables leaving our eyes and skin without adequate protection.

It is a broad spectrum anti-microbial as well as having many other valuable properties. In China the flowers of this particular species have been used for over 4000 years as an important plant medicine. Traditionally Chrysanthemum has been used in China to treat headaches sore throats and fevers as well as eye disorders like red eyes blurred vision and near-sightedness. Chrysanthemum can be used to treat hypertension vertigo dizziness and help resolve certain skin disorders like abscesses and ulcers. It has also been used to treat insomnia in Korea. Chrysanthemum flowers and leaves are rich in flavinoids which are a class of compounds known to have anti-inflammatory antioxidant anticarcinogenic and cardioprotective properties. The two principal flavinoids in Chrysanthemum are Luteolin and Apigenin as well as some Quercetin. Modest amounts of essential oils are present in the flowers 0.2-.85%. Chrysanthemum also contains Isobutyl-amides immune modulating compounds also found in Echinacea. Most importantly Chrysanthemum has anti-bacterial anti-fungal anti-parasitic and antiviralproperties is cardioprotective neuroprotective and has potent antioxidant properties. Ihave found it to be especially useful in a wide variety of viral infections both acute and chronic as well as bacterial infections including Lyme. Almost across the board when patients begin taking Chrysanthemum they report a greater sense of wellbeing and some report increased-energy. I\u2019ve also seen great effects with patients who suffer from chronic aches and pains as in Fibromyalgia. With muscle testing it generally seems to strengthen most people in the clear. I find Chrysanthemum to be useful in a broad range of applications from a gentle cardiovascular and brain tonic to a potent anti-microbial agent. Chrysanthemum is very safe large quantities having been tested in animal models for extended periods of time (Rat models fed up to 15g\/kg body mass for 14 days in one study and 1280g\/kg body mass for 26 weeks in another study both with no adverse effects)Chrysanthemum extracts have been shown to be cytotoxic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Extracts have also been shown to be anti-mutagenic against Salmonella typhimirium. Of special note were several studies which showed strong effects at inhibiting HIV by both interfering with the integrase enzyme as well as direct anti-HIV activity in cell-culture. In one study extracts from Chrysanthemum significantly reduced neuronal defects extent of infarction brain edema and improved the production of super-oxide dismutase (SOD) in brain tissue following ischemic stroke in animal models . In another study Chrysanthemum extracts were shown to be protective against oxidative damage and cytotoxic drugs by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in brain tissue. There is some evidence that Chrysanthemum is protective against damage from heavymetals particularly lead. In one study Chrysanthemum extracts were shown to be protective against lead-induced oxidative injury as well as being hepatoprotective and nephroprotective. In heart tissue Chrysanthemum has been shown to be cardioprotective acting as an anti-arrhythmic agent increasing the action of papillary heart muscles and protecting against oxidized LDL the precursor to atherosclerotic plaque. It has also been shown to prevent apoptosis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. High doses of Chrysanthemum have been used over a course of several months for coronary artery disease leading to improvements in 86% of patient symptom scores and 45% improvement on objective EKG findings. In summary we test Vitalguard Supreme on all patients due to its general health enhancing properties and broad range of applications (as we do with all the other Supreme Nutrition products). It is a great anti-microbial and possibly like Morinda can act as a preventative. It also appears to improve health in general. When using it as an anti-microbial we let our testing dictate whether we use it as a stand alone or in combination with other products such as Morinda Melia Golden Thread and Schisandra. We have read of no contraindications during pregnancy (after exhaustively searching for them) so it might be the treatment of choice when treating dysbiosis during pregnancy but as with any herb during pregnancy monitor your patients closely.","64127":"Baby growth & developmentCritical for fetal & infant brain cardiovascular eye immune & nervous system health No fishy taste!Unflavored & safe for sensitive tummies; enteric coated to easily swallow & digest Purity & peace of mindMolecularly distilled to concentrate & purify impurities allergens mercury PCBs dioxins & environmental toxics (exceeding US & int'l protocols) Proudly made in the USA Ultra puregentle & enrichinghigh potency100% naturalhonestly wholesome There's no denying it ~ your body needs the omega-3 fatty acid DHA.

It influences elasticity and therefore wrinkling of the skin. Additionally H.A. addresses oxidative stress in our skin by scavenging free radicals that are unleashed by ultraviolet rays from the sun. Equally important H.A. is abundant in the vitreous humor of our eyes and the synovial fluid of our joints. In the joints it helps to maintain viscosity and lubrication essentially acting as a shock absorber between moving bones. Research also shows the potential of H.A. in its role neutralizing free radicals in sensitive areas where articular cartilage is found.* As a result of normal aging levels of H.A. diminish often leading to less youthful skin and joints.

Compared to North America 10 times more people in Yuzurihara were living beyond the age of 85. More importantly than lifespan alone the inhabitants also aged healthfully enjoying great joint mobility healthy vision and unusually smooth and well-toned skin. The health of the villagers was largely attributed to their diet\u2014one that is rich in Hyaluronic Acid! Key Joint Components in a BottleArticular cartilage in our synovial joints is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes bound together by a matrix of collagen fibers (mainly type II collagen) and proteoglycans with varying glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains including chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid. This combination of water-binding GAGs within a collagen network provides the tensile properties of articular cartilage which peaks in humans around age 30.  Experience BioCell TechnologyType II collagen is the major component of the specialized hyaline cartilage that is found in our joints. Research on type II collagen\u2014first done using animals and subsequently in humans\u2014describes the safety and effectiveness of this compound when taken orally to support joint health. For example in a pioneering randomized controlled trial subjects taking type II collagen for 3 months experienced greater joint comfort than those on placebo.Integrated Support Goes FurtherChondroitin sulfate (CS) has been studied extensively in humans displaying a notable record of safety and effectiveness in promoting joint health. CS acts on chondrocytes to produce yet more proteoglycans influencing levels of articular cartilage. Even as the joint mobility and comfort benefits from CS can often be seen relatively quickly science has likewise shown that structural benefits can accumulate with long-term continued use. Aside from its antioxidant roles Vitamin C is included to support healthy articular cartilage and other connective tissue through collagen formation. It has been known for some time that vitamin C promotes healthy chondrocytes; this is complimented by the quercetin in Ultimate H.A. not only regenerating vitamin C but also enhancing the integrity of the hyaluronic acid and collagen matrix in cartilage. On top of this quercetin also supports the integrity of our skin via its antioxidant function. H.A. is Not Only for Joints It's Also for Beauty From WithinHyaluronic acid is not just for joints but also an essential component of skin that keeps it healthy supple hydrated and youthful.
